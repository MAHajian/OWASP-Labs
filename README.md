# OWASP-Labs
In this Repo I will write some owasp labs for different web application vulnerabilities 💉


## How Can I run in my local system or my server? 🤔
```bash
php -S 0:9090 # you can set any port you want :)
```
⚠️ ```if you want run in your public server, Becareful run this labs in low level user or run under vm for security reasons...! ```⚠️
